# hyperskill-python-simple-chatty-bot
### My Simple Chatty Bot project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number**: #2

**Difficulty:** Easy

**About:** A simple console chat bot which introduces itself, asks the user to introduce themselves, guesse the user's age using arithmetic operations, counts up to the number the user specified, and gives a test to the user and checks the answers. The bot repeats the test until the user answers correctly.

**Learning outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and completing numerous problems, I was learning about the basics of Python further. It helped me to gain more knowledge of the basic Python syntax, and create a simple program using using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
